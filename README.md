# scurl
This is a secure version of curl I wrote for my final project in cs255 (Cryptography).
Standard curl has many vulnerabilities, most of which are certificate verification attacks. I implemented the program with this in mind, testing on several thousand sites.
I will soon update the repo to contain my test files.
